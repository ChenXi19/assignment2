Abstract 
---
This assignment is a display of several codings of different deepth-which use ASCII to show letters on the screen.


Background Information 
---
ASCII abreviated form American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character-encoding scheme to represent text in computers, communication equipment, and other devices that use text. Originally based on the Englishalphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers, consisting only 0 and 1. The characters encoded are numbers from 0 to 9, lowercase letters from a to z, uppercase letters from A to Z, basic punctuation symbols and space. ([More information on ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII))
